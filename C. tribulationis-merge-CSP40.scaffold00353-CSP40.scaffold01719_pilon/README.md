C. tribulationis, scaffold CSP40.scaffold00353, harboring Ctr-xol-1, and CSP40.scaffold01719, exhibit overlapping sequences. Furthermore, these scaffolds demonstrate collinearity with the continuous CniX region, which also harbors Cni-xol-1. Consequently, CSP40.scaffold00353 and CSP40.scaffold01719 are highly likely to represent consecutive segments of the CtrX region. Based on BLASTn end alignments, scaffolds CSP40.scaffold00353 and CSP40.scaffold01719 were merged and subsequently polished with Pilon, resulting in the formation of a new scaffold named 'merge-CSP40.scaffold00353-CSP40.scaffold01719_pilon'. The annotations from the two original scaffolds were transferred to the new scaffold using Liftoff (v1.6.3).
