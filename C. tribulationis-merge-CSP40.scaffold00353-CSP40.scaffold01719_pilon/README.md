### Assembly and Annotation Update

In *C. tribulationis*, scaffold **CSP40.scaffold00353** (harboring *Ctr-xol-1*) and **CSP40.scaffold01719** were found to contain overlapping sequences. Both scaffolds show strong collinearity with the continuous **CniX** region, which also harbors *Cni-xol-1*. This indicates that **CSP40.scaffold00353** and **CSP40.scaffold01719** most likely represent consecutive segments of the **CtrX** region.

Based on BLASTn end alignments, the two scaffolds were merged and subsequently polished using **Pilon**, resulting in a new scaffold named:

```
merge-CSP40.scaffold00353-CSP40.scaffold01719_pilon
```

All annotations from the original scaffolds were transferred to the merged scaffold using **Liftoff (v1.6.3)**.
