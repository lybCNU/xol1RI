# Hybrid Male Incompatibility and X-Chromosome Repression in *Caenorhabditis*

This repository contains data supporting the study:

> **Aberrant X chromosome dosage compensation causes hybrid male inviability in **Caenorhabditis***

Our research demonstrates that hybrid male inviability arises from insufficient expression of the *Cbr-xol-1* gene in specific interspecies crosses. Aberrant repression of X-linked transcription leads to embryonic lethality, providing a mechanistic basis for the evolution of reproductive isolation.
