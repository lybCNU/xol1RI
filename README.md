# Hybrid Male Incompatibility and X-Chromosome Repression in *Caenorhabditis*

This repository contains data supporting the study:

> **Sex determination incompatibility drives zygotic reproductive isolation in *Caenorhabditis***

Our research demonstrates that hybrid male inviability arises from insufficient expression of the *Cbr-xol-1* gene in specific interspecies crosses. Aberrant repression of X-linked transcription leads to embryonic lethality, providing a mechanistic basis for the evolution of reproductive isolation.

## Data Usage

All sequencing data are organized by experimental type and species cross. Please refer to individual folders for metadata and sample identifiers.

* Raw data are provided in standard formats (FASTQ, BAM, etc.).
* Processed data (normalized counts, peak files, allele-specific tables) are included for direct analysis.
