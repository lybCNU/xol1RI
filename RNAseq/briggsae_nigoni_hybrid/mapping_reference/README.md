# README (mapping\_reference)

## Overview

This folder contains the reference genome and annotation files used for sequence alignment in the RNA-seq analysis of *Caenorhabditis briggsae* and *Caenorhabditis nigoni*. The files were generated by combining the genome assemblies and annotations from both species into a single reference set. To ensure clarity, chromosome identifiers were prefixed with **cbr** (for *C. briggsae*) or **cni** (for *C. nigoni*).

## Files

* **cn.ASM2792064v1\_cbWS290.PRJNA10731.fa.gz**: Combined genome sequence of *C. nigoni* (ASM2792064v1) and *C. briggsae* (WS290.PRJNA10731) with prefixed chromosome identifiers.
* **cn.ASM2792064v1\_cbWS290.PRJNA10731.gtf.gz**: Combined annotation file corresponding to the merged genome.

## Sources

* **C. nigoni**:

  * Genome assembly: ASM2792064v1
  * Annotation: Derived using **Liftoff** from `c_nigoni.PRJNA384657.WS290.annotations.gff3.gz`
* **C. briggsae**:

  * Genome assembly: WS290.PRJNA10731
  * Annotation: Obtained directly from `c_briggsae.PRJNA10731.WS290.annotations.gff3.gz`

## Notes

* The combined genome and annotation were constructed to facilitate accurate interspecific RNA-seq read mapping.
* Prefixes (**cbr**, **cni**) were added to distinguish chromosomes and gene features from each species.
