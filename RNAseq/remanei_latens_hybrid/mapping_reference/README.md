# README (mapping\_reference)

## Overview

This folder contains the reference genome and annotation files used for sequence alignment in the RNA-seq analysis of *Caenorhabditis remanei* and *Caenorhabditis latens*. The files were generated by combining the genome assemblies and annotations from both species into a single reference set. To ensure clarity, chromosome identifiers were prefixed with **PX439** (for *C. remanei*) or **PX534** (for *C. latens*).

## Files

* **PX439.ASM225922v3_PX534.ASM225923v3.fa.gz**: Combined genome sequence of *C. latens* (ASM225923v3) and *C. remanei* (ASM225922v3) with prefixed chromosome identifiers.
* **PX439.PRJNA577507.WBPS19.liftoff_PX534.PRJNA248912.WBPS19.liftoff.gtf.gz**: Combined annotation file corresponding to the merged genome.

## Sources

* **C. latens**:

  * Genome assembly: ASM225923v3
  * Annotation: Derived using **Liftoff** from `caenorhabditis_latens.PRJNA248912.WBPS19.annotations.gff3.gz`
* **C. remanei**:

  * Genome assembly: ASM225922v3
  * Annotation: Derived using **Liftoff** from `caenorhabditis_remanei. PRJNA577507.WBPS19.annotations.gff3.gz`

## Notes

* The combined genome and annotation were constructed to facilitate accurate interspecific RNA-seq read mapping.
* Prefixes (**PX439**, **PX534**) were added to distinguish chromosomes and gene features from each species.
