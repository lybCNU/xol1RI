## Project Overview

This repository provides transcriptomic data and analysis for *Caenorhabditis remanei*, *Caenorhabditis latens*, and their hybrid embryos at the comma stage of development. 

## Data

* **RNAseq.RDS**: Processed RNA-seq dataset containing transcriptome profiles of *C. remanei*, *C. latens*, and their hybrid embryos.

## Code

* **fig7.R**: Script for generating Figure 77.

## Reference Files

* **mapping\_reference/**: Directory containing reference genomes and GTF files used for sequence alignment.

## Usage

1. Load the processed RNA-seq dataset (`RNAseq.RDS`) into R.
2. Use the scripts (`fig7.R`) to reproduce the figures presented in the study.
