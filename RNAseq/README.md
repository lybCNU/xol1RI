# Hybrid Embryo Transcriptomic Data and Analysis

This repository contains transcriptomic data and analyses for **Caenorhabditis** species and their hybrid embryos at the **comma stage of development**.  

It is organized into two main directories:  

---

## ðŸ“‚ remanei_latens_hybrid
Transcriptomic data and analysis for:
- *Caenorhabditis remanei*
- *Caenorhabditis latens*
- Their hybrid embryos (comma stage)

This folder includes raw and processed transcriptomic data, scripts for preprocessing, and analysis pipelines specific to the *remanei* Ã— *latens* cross.

---

## ðŸ“‚ briggsae_nigoni_hybrid
Transcriptomic data and analysis for:
- *Caenorhabditis briggsae*
- *Caenorhabditis nigoni*
- Their hybrid embryos (comma stage)

This folder contains corresponding transcriptomic datasets and analyses for the *briggsae* Ã— *nigoni* cross.

## ðŸ”¬ Project Overview
This project investigates the genetic basis of **hybrid male inviability** in *Caenorhabditis* species.  
We show that crosses between species (e.g., *C. briggsae Ã— C. nigoni* and *C. remanei Ã— C. latens*) reveal incompatibilities in **xol-1 regulation** and **X-chromosome transcription**, leading to aberrant repression and hybrid male lethality.  
These findings highlight **sex determination incompatibility** as a driver of reproductive isolation.
